Shri Arvind Gaur's Asmita Theatre Group are one of the leading exponents of using \"Theatre for Social Change\" . Arvind has been at the forefront of the movement for a Corruption Free India and has agreed to run workshops where volunteers will be trained to act in and train others on street plays that convince the \"Aam Aadmi\" that they are the primary victims of corruption and that they can make change happen.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to learn from a master and contribute towards a corruption free India. Till mid July these workshops will be run in Delhi and from mid July to end July 45 master trainers from Asmita are willing to run workshops in different parts of India. \n\nTo learn more and/or join the Street Play Army send an email to asmitatheatre@gmail.com. People from all over India can join. We have also created an event. Join the event and comment. Your suggestions and ideas are welcome.",

      "content": "The next is Germany United Nations Development Programme: Promotion of Democracy in the Middle East. According to the Arabs \u00e2\u0080\u009cDemocracy is like an alien to their religion\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is definitely completely inappropriate, and this is according to the Arabs and not the Muslims, which most people will assume. Here women are basically considered second class and have almost nothing or very little rights. A number of organizations have taken a step forward to promote democracy like:\tNED. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) is a semi-private, nonprofit organization created in 1983 to strengthen democratic institutions around the world through non-governmental efforts. NDI. The National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI) is a nonprofit organization funded by NED that works to strengthen and expand democracy worldwide. MEPI. The Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) is a U.S. State Department program designed to promote political, economic, and educational development in the Middle East. The Seoul Plan of Action suggests a variety of measures the Community of Democracies could undertake, preferably within the framework of regional or international organizations like: regional democracy-monitoring mechanisms; monitoring systems for democratic crisis so that early assistance can be provided;  creating a cadre of experts to assist countries facing a threat to their democracy; long-term technical support or monitors to strengthen democratic institutions, election processes, and reform efforts .
